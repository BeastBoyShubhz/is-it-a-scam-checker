> **Disclaimer:** This is general information, not legal or financial advice. If you have been affected, contact your bank and local authorities immediately.

## Quick Take

- Scammers are constantly evolving their tactics — staying informed is your best defence.
- The most common scam categories remain phishing emails, fake investment schemes, and impersonation calls.
- Anyone can be targeted, regardless of age or tech-savviness.

## How the Con Works

Most scams follow a predictable pattern: the scammer creates a sense of **urgency** or **fear**, impersonates a trusted organisation, and pushes the victim to act quickly — before they have time to think critically.

Common approaches include:

- **Phishing emails** that mimic banks, government agencies, or delivery companies.
- **Phone calls** claiming to be from the tax office, police, or tech support.
- **Text messages** with suspicious links promising refunds, prize winnings, or package tracking.
- **Social media** messages from accounts impersonating friends, family, or public figures.

## Red Flags

- 🚩 You are asked to act immediately or face consequences.
- 🚩 The message contains a link you did not expect.
- 🚩 You are asked to provide personal information, passwords, or payment details.
- 🚩 The sender's email address or phone number looks slightly off.
- 🚩 The offer sounds too good to be true.

## What to Do If You Engaged

1. **Stop all contact** with the suspected scammer immediately.
2. **Contact your bank** or financial institution to report suspicious transactions.
3. **Change your passwords** — especially for email, banking, and social media.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication** on all important accounts.
5. **Monitor your accounts** for any unusual activity over the coming weeks.
