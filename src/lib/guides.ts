<p>Found a website selling exactly what you want at a price that seems almost too good? Before you hand over your card details, take two minutes to run through these checks. It could save you hundreds.</p>

<p>Dodgy websites are everywhere — they copy real brand logos, use professional photos, and look completely legitimate. The difference is in the details.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Fake online stores that take your money and never send anything, or harvest your card details for fraud.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Anyone shopping online, especially during sales events or when searching for hard-to-find items.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prices 70-90% off</strong> — If it looks too good to be true, it is. Real retailers don't slash prices that dramatically.</li>
  <li><strong>No physical address or phone number</strong> — Legitimate businesses list contact details. A contact form only is suspicious.</li>
  <li><strong>Generic email addresses</strong> — support@gmail.com instead of support@businessname.com.au</li>
  <li><strong>Payment only via bank transfer or crypto</strong> — Legit stores accept cards and PayPal because they offer buyer protection.</li>
  <li><strong>Newly registered domain</strong> — Check via whois.domaintools.com. If the site claims "established 2010" but domain registered last month, run.</li>
  <li><strong>Missing or copied policies</strong> — Fake sites either have no returns policy or copy-paste generic text with wrong company names.</li>
  <li><strong>No social media presence</strong> — Or accounts with zero engagement and stock photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Poor grammar and odd phrasing</strong> — Professional retailers proofread their content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Examples</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-lg border">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">Example 1: The "Closing Down Sale"</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">A Facebook ad for "Brand X Australia" claims they're closing down with 80% off everything. The website looks professional but the domain is brandx-au-sale.com instead of the real brandx.com.au.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-lg border">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">Example 2: The Cloned Store</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">You search for a specific shoe and find a site with the exact same layout as a major retailer. The URL is just slightly different: footlocker-au.com instead of footlocker.com.au.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-lg border">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">Example 3: The Social Media Shop</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">An Instagram ad leads to a beautifully designed site. All reviews are 5 stars and dated within the past week. The About Us page mentions being "based in Melbourne" but the contact email ends in .ru.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Google the site name + "scam" or "review"</strong> — Other victims often post warnings.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the domain age</strong> — Use whois.domaintools.com to see when it was registered.</li>
  <li><strong>Look for the padlock</strong> — HTTPS is good, but it doesn't guarantee legitimacy. Scammers use SSL too.</li>
  <li><strong>Search for the company on ABN Lookup</strong> — abr.business.gov.au shows registered Australian businesses.</li>
  <li><strong>Use our checker</strong> — Paste the URL and we'll flag known red flags instantly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If You Already Paid</h2>
<div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credit card:</strong> Contact your bank immediately to dispute the charge. You have chargeback rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Debit card:</strong> Call your bank. Harder to recover but still possible if you act fast.</li>
    <li><strong>Bank transfer:</strong> Contact your bank but be aware recovery is unlikely. Report to ReportCyber.</li>
    <li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Open a dispute within 180 days. PayPal buyer protection may cover you.</li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does HTTPS mean a website is safe?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">No. HTTPS means data is encrypted in transit, but scammers get SSL certificates too. It's a baseline, not proof of legitimacy.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can I trust reviews on the website itself?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Be skeptical. Fake sites often display fabricated 5-star reviews. Look for reviews on independent sites like Trustpilot or ProductReview.com.au.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What if the prices are just really good?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Compare with the official brand website. If the "sale" price is lower than wholesale cost would be, something's wrong.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How do scammers get my details to a fake site?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Usually through social media ads, search engine ads, or phishing emails. Google doesn't always catch fake advertiser sites immediately.</p>

<p>Scammers are experts at making dangerous links look legitimate. A single click on the wrong link can lead to stolen passwords, drained bank accounts, or malware on your device.</p>

<p>The good news? Once you know the tricks, they're easy to spot. Takes 10 seconds.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Phishing pages designed to steal your login credentials or payment details.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone. These links arrive via SMS, email, WhatsApp, and social media.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subdomain tricks</strong> — The real domain is what comes right before the .com/.com.au. In "commbank.secure-login.com", the real domain is secure-login.com, NOT commbank.</li>
  <li><strong>Letter substitutions</strong> — "rn" looks like "m", "1" looks like "l", "0" looks like "O". Watch for amaz0n.com or paypa1.com.</li>
  <li><strong>Extra words added</strong> — commbank-verify.com, ato-refund-portal.com, auspost-delivery.net</li>
  <li><strong>Wrong domain extension</strong> — Real Australian sites use .com.au or .gov.au. Scams often use .com, .net, .xyz, .top.</li>
  <li><strong>URL shorteners</strong> — bit.ly, tinyurl.com hide the real destination. Legitimate businesses rarely use these.</li>
  <li><strong>Random characters</strong> — Long strings of letters and numbers are suspicious: track-pkg-au.com/delivery/8f7a2c...</li>
  <li><strong>Punycode attacks</strong> — International characters that look like English letters. applе.com (using Cyrillic е) looks identical to apple.com.</li>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Don't click</strong> — If you're suspicious, don't risk it.</li>

<p>Australians lose millions to SMS scams every year. These texts look official, create urgency, and lead to fake websites designed to steal your money or identity.</p>

<p>Here's what the most common scam texts look like — and why they work.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Phishing attempts designed to steal bank logins, card details, or personal information.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone with a mobile phone. Scammers send millions of these daily.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Urgency language</strong> — "Immediate action required", "within 24 hours", "account will be suspended"</li>
  <li><strong>Generic sender</strong> — A mobile number (+61 4xx) claiming to be from a bank or government agency</li>
  <li><strong>Links to click</strong> — Real banks and government agencies don't send login links via SMS</li>
  <li><strong>Requests for codes</strong> — No legitimate organisation asks you to share verification codes</li>
  <li><strong>Spelling and grammar errors</strong> — "Your AuPost parcel" or "Confirm you're identity"</li>
  <li><strong>Unusual domain in link</strong> — Look for .xyz, .top, .info, or misspelled brand names</li>
  <li><strong>Out of the blue</strong> — You weren't expecting a parcel or haven't done anything with that service</li>
</ul>

<p>WhatsApp scams have exploded in Australia. The "Hi Mum" scam alone cost Australians over $7 million in a single year. These scammers are clever, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Impersonation scams asking for urgent money transfers, or investment scams promising unrealistic returns.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Parents and grandparents (Hi Mum scams), anyone interested in making money (crypto scams).</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Hi Mum/Dad, I've got a new number"</strong> — The classic opener. Real kids would just tell you, not ask for money immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Urgency + money request</strong> — "I need $2000 by tonight or I'll be evicted/stranded/arrested"</li>
  <li><strong>Can't talk on phone</strong> — "My phone is broken, can only text"</li>
  <li><strong>Asks for PayID or bank transfer</strong> — Not Beem, not their usual account</li>
  <li><strong>Added to random crypto groups</strong> — "VIP Investment Signals" with screenshots of huge profits</li>
  <li><strong>Romance that moves fast</strong> — Met on a dating app, now on WhatsApp, and suddenly needs money</li>

  <li><strong>Never send money to new account details</strong> — Verify any payment request through another channel.</li>

<p>Phishing emails are getting scary good. AI helps scammers write perfect English, copy brand styles pixel-perfectly, and target victims with personalised attacks. Even tech-savvy people get caught.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Fake login pages to steal credentials, malware disguised as invoices, or payment redirection scams.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone. Business email compromise (BEC) targets companies; credential phishing targets individuals.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sender address doesn't match</strong> — "Netflix" but from netflix-billing@mail-service.com</li>
  <li><strong>Generic greetings</strong> — "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name</li>
  <li><strong>Urgency and threats</strong> — "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours"</li>
  <li><strong>Unexpected attachments</strong> — Invoice.pdf.exe, Document.docm, or ZIP files</li>
  <li><strong>Links to wrong domains</strong> — Hover (don't click) to see the real URL</li>
  <li><strong>Requests for sensitive info</strong> — Passwords, 2FA codes, card numbers</li>
  <li><strong>Too good to be true</strong> — "You've won!" or "Unclaimed refund awaiting"</li>

<p>PayID scams have become the go-to method for ripping off people selling items online. The scam sounds convincing and many sellers fall for it, losing hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Fake "overpayment" claims or fake "business account upgrade" fees designed to get you to send money to scammers.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Anyone selling items on Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree, or similar platforms.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the Scam Works</h2>
<p>You're selling something online. A buyer contacts you and seems keen. Then one of these scenarios unfolds:</p>

<h3>Scenario 1: The Overpayment</h3>
<p>"I accidentally paid you $2,500 instead of $250 for your item. Can you refund the extra $2,250 to this account?"</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> You never received any payment. The fake "payment confirmation" email is spoofed. If you "refund" the overpayment, you're sending your own money to a scammer.</p>

<h3>Scenario 2: The Business Account Upgrade</h3>
<p>"I tried to pay but your account can't receive business payments. You need to upgrade to a PayID Business Account. Pay the $99 upgrade fee and I'll add it to my payment for the item."</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> There's no such thing as a "PayID Business Account upgrade fee". PayID is a free service from your bank.</p>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"I accidentally paid too much"</strong> — This almost never happens legitimately.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment confirmations via email</strong> — Real payments show in your banking app, not just emails.</li>
  <li><strong>"Upgrade your account"</strong> — PayID doesn't have paid tiers or upgrades.</li>
  <li><strong>Wants you to pay fees</strong> — Legitimate buyers don't ask sellers to pay anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Unusually eager buyer</strong> — Agrees to your price immediately, no negotiation.</li>
  <li><strong>Can't meet in person</strong> — Always has an excuse to avoid face-to-face.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure and urgency</strong> — "I need it shipped today" or "Refund now or I'll report you".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Examples</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">Fake Email Confirmation</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">You receive an email: "PayID Payment Confirmation - You have received $2,500.00 from John Smith. This payment is pending due to your account limits. Contact the sender for further action."</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> This email is fake. Real PayID payments appear instantly in your banking app. No email confirmations, no pending status for standard amounts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Upgrade Fee Script</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">"Your PayID is registered as a personal account. To receive my business payment, you'll need to upgrade. Transfer $99 to this BSB/Account and send me the receipt. I'll add it to my payment."</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> Complete fiction. PayID works the same for personal and business payments. There's no upgrade. You'd be sending $99 to a scammer.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Only check your actual banking app</strong> — Not emails, not screenshots. Log into your real bank.</li>
  <li><strong>There's no such thing as a PayID upgrade fee</strong> — Anyone asking for one is a scammer.</li>
  <li><strong>Never refund "overpayments"</strong> — If you didn't see cash in your bank account, it didn't happen.</li>
  <li><strong>Meet in person when possible</strong> — Cash deals at police stations are safest.</li>
  <li><strong>Report the scammer</strong> — To the platform and to Scamwatch.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If You've Sent Money</h2>
<div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contact your bank immediately</strong> — Some transfers can be stopped or recalled if fast enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Report to police</strong> — Via ReportCyber (cyber.gov.au)</li>
    <li><strong>Report to the platform</strong> — Facebook, Gumtree, etc. will ban the account.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep all evidence</strong> — Screenshots of conversations, emails, any details.</li>

    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Is PayID itself safe?</summary>

<p>Tax time brings out the scammers. They impersonate the ATO, threatening arrest or promising refunds. These scams cost Australians millions every year — and they're alarmingly convincing.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Phishing for your myGov login, identity theft via personal information collection, or direct theft via fake "tax debt" payments.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone, but especially around tax time (July-October) and just after tax returns are lodged.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the ATO Will NEVER Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Threaten arrest over the phone</strong> — The ATO doesn't send police to your door over tax debt.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for payment via gift cards, crypto, or wire transfers</strong> — Scam payment methods, always.</li>
  <li><strong>Send you a link via SMS to claim a refund</strong> — Refunds are processed through your tax return and myGov.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for your TFN, password, or credit card over phone/SMS</strong> — They already have your TFN, and never need your password.</li>
  <li><strong>Request remote access to your computer</strong> — No legitimate agency does this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Links in SMS</strong> — Real ATO messages don't include clickable links.</li>
  <li><strong>Threats of immediate arrest</strong> — "Police warrant has been issued" is a scam line.</li>
  <li><strong>"Confirm your identity" links</strong> — Always go directly to my.gov.au.</li>
  <li><strong>Fake myGov domains</strong> — mygov-refund.com, my-gov.com.au, mygov-au.net are all fake. Real is my.gov.au only.</li>
  <li><strong>Unexpected refund announcements</strong> — If you haven't lodged, you're not getting a refund.</li>
  <li><strong>Robocalls</strong> — Recorded messages saying to "press 1" are scams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bank impersonation scams are terrifyingly effective. Scammers can make their caller ID show your bank's actual phone number. They know your name. They sound professional. And they create just enough panic to make you act before you think.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Social engineering to get you to transfer money to a "safe account" (the scammer's account) or share 2FA codes.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone with a bank account. Scammers often target older Australians but anyone can get caught.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"We've detected fraud on your account"</strong> — The classic opener designed to create panic.</li>
  <li><strong>"Did you authorise this transaction?"</strong> — Creates urgency when you say no.</li>
  <li><strong>"Move your money to a safe account"</strong> — Banks NEVER ask you to do this. Ever.</li>
  <li><strong>"Read me the code we just sent"</strong> — 2FA codes are for YOU to use, not to share.</li>
  <li><strong>"Don't tell anyone about this call"</strong> — Isolation tactic so you can't get a second opinion.</li>
  <li><strong>They call you</strong> — If you didn't initiate the call, be suspicious.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure to act immediately</strong> — "The transaction is going through now, we only have minutes."</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook Marketplace is a goldmine for scammers. They target sellers with fake payment confirmations, buyers with items that don't exist, and everyone with increasingly creative tricks. Here's how to protect yourself.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Fake payment confirmations, overpayment scams, or non-existent items. Scammers target both buyers and sellers.</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Anyone buying or selling on Marketplace, especially high-value items.</p>
</div>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Can't meet in person</strong> — "I'm interstate but my courier will collect it"</li>
  <li><strong>Overpays then asks for refund</strong> — "Oops I sent $500 too much, please refund"</li>
  <li><strong>Payment confirmation via email only</strong> — Real payments show in your bank app or PayPal</li>
  <li><strong>Eager buyer, no negotiation</strong> — "I'll take it, full price, right now"</li>
  <li><strong>Asks you to click a link</strong> — For "secure payment" or "shipping label"</li>
  <li><strong>Requests gift cards as payment</strong> — Never legitimate</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure to ship before payment clears</strong> — "My courier is coming today"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Examples</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Courier Collection Scam</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">"Hi! I'm interested in your item. I'm in Perth for work but I'll send my courier to collect. I'll pay via PayPal — please send your email so I can process payment. Once paid, just give the item to the courier driver."</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> You'll receive a fake PayPal email. If you hand over the item, you'll never see payment. Real PayPal payments show in your actual PayPal account (log in directly, don't click email links).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Overpayment Trick</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">"Payment sent! Oh no, I accidentally paid $800 instead of $300. The extra $500 was meant for the courier. Can you please transfer $500 to this account so he can pick it up today?"</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> No payment was ever sent. If you "refund" the overpayment, you're sending your own money to a scammer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Too-Good Deal (Buyer Scam)</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">iPhone 15 Pro Max, brand new sealed, $500. "Selling cheap because I won it in a raffle and already have one. Pickup only in [remote suburb] or I can post after payment."</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> The item doesn't exist or is counterfeit. They'll take payment and disappear. If the price seems too good, it is.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Meet in person, in public</strong> — Police stations have designated safe-exchange zones.</li>
  <li><strong>Cash for local sales</strong> — No fake PayPal emails, no chargebacks, no drama.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify payments independently</strong> — Log into your actual bank/PayPal. Don't trust email confirmations.</li>
  <li><strong>Never ship before payment clears</strong> — Wait for the money to actually appear in your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Marketplace's own payment system</strong> — Offers some buyer/seller protection.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If You've Been Scammed</h2>
<div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Report to Facebook</strong> — Tap the listing or conversation > Report > Scam.</li>
    <li><strong>Report to Scamwatch</strong> — scamwatch.gov.au</li>
    <li><strong>Contact your bank</strong> — If you sent money, they may be able to recall it.</li>
    <li><strong>PayPal dispute</strong> — If you paid goods & services, you have buyer protection.</li>
  </ul>

    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Is it safe to give my PayPal email to a buyer?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Only if you verify payment by logging into PayPal directly (not via email links). Scammers send fake payment confirmation emails. Always check your real PayPal balance.</p>

    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What if they want to pay with PayPal Friends & Family?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Don't accept it. Friends & Family has no buyer/seller protection. There's no reason a stranger would use this legitimately.</p>

<p>Parcel delivery scams are Australia's most common text scam. Everyone shops online, everyone expects parcels, so these messages catch lots of people off guard. The scam links lead to fake sites that steal your card details.</p>

<h2>Quick Verdict</h2>
<div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p><strong>What it usually is:</strong> Phishing pages disguised as delivery company websites, designed to steal your card details via fake "redelivery fees" or "customs charges".</p>
  <p><strong>Who gets targeted:</strong> Everyone. These are mass-sent texts hoping to catch someone actually waiting for a parcel.</p>
</div>

<h2>Real vs Fake: How to Tell</h2>
<p><strong>Real AusPost never:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sends SMS with clickable links for redelivery</li>
  <li>Asks for payment via text message</li>
  <li>Uses domains other than auspost.com.au</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How real notifications work:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Card left at your door or in letterbox</li>
  <li>Notification in the AusPost app</li>
  <li>Collection from post office with tracking number and ID</li>
</ul>

<h2>Red Flags to Look For</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Random mobile number as sender</strong> — Real AusPost messages come from "AusPost", not +61 4xx xxx xxx</li>
  <li><strong>Strange domains</strong> — auspost-delivery.net, auspost-au.com, tracking-parcel.info — all fake</li>
  <li><strong>"Pay a small fee"</strong> — $2.50 redelivery, $1.95 customs fee — designed to seem too small to question</li>
  <li><strong>Urgency</strong> — "Parcel will be returned in 24 hours" or "final delivery attempt"</li>
  <li><strong>No tracking number</strong> — Or a tracking number that doesn't match anything you ordered</li>
  <li><strong>Weren't expecting a parcel</strong> — If you haven't ordered anything, it's definitely a scam</li>
</ul>

<h2>Realistic Examples</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Redelivery Fee Scam</p>
    <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-2">"AustPost: We attempted delivery but no one was home. Pay $2.99 redelivery fee to reschedule: auspost-au-track.com/redeliver"</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> AusPost doesn't charge redelivery fees via SMS. That domain is fake. The site will look real and steal your card details.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Customs Charge</p>
    <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-2">"DHL: Your international parcel is held at customs. Pay $3.50 processing fee to release: dhl-customs-au.com/pay"</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> Real customs charges come with official documentation and are paid to ABF, not via random text links. DHL would contact you through official channels.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
    <p class="font-medium mb-2">The Address Confirmation</p>
    <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-2">"FedEx: We couldn't deliver your package due to incomplete address. Confirm details here: fedex-au-delivery.info"</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-red-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> They want you to enter your address, name, and card "for verification". It's all harvested for fraud.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>What to Do Next</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Don't click the link</strong> — Delete the message immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Check directly</strong> — Go to auspost.com.au or the official carrier site and enter your tracking number.</li>
  <li><strong>Use official apps</strong> — AusPost, DHL, FedEx apps show real delivery status.</li>
  <li><strong>Report it</strong> — Forward scam SMS to 0429 999 888 (Scamwatch SMS reporting).</li>
  <li><strong>Block the number</strong> — Though scammers use different numbers constantly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>If You Entered Your Card Details</h2>
<div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Call your bank immediately</strong> — Report the card compromised and get it cancelled.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor statements</strong> — Watch for unauthorized charges over the coming weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Report to Scamwatch</strong> — scamwatch.gov.au</li>
    <li><strong>Consider a credit check</strong> — If you entered personal details too, watch for identity theft.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="space-y-4 my-6">
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Why do I keep getting these even though I never click?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Scammers send millions of messages randomly. Your number was probably generated or is on a leaked list. Getting the texts doesn't mean you're being specifically targeted.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does AusPost ever send legitimate SMS?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Yes, for tracking updates — but never with payment links. Real AusPost SMS tells you your parcel status and where to collect it, no links to pay fees.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What if I'm actually waiting for a parcel?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Check your order confirmation for the tracking number, then track directly on the official carrier website. Don't use any links from SMS.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg p-4">
    <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can they steal money if I just clicked but didn't enter details?</summary>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Usually no. Just visiting the page doesn't give them access. The danger is entering information. If you just clicked and closed, you're probably fine.</p>
